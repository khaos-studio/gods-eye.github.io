Welcome to the Gods Eye development log, where we'll be sharing updates on the progress of our animated series. We've recently entered pre-production of the interstitial, a 2-minute animation that introduces some of the core characters for the series. We're using a mix of solutions, but the primary animation tool we're leveraging is Moho. Given our limited resources and the abundance of technological advances, we're also using machine learning to accelerate our efforts.

## character generation

As a lifelong illustrator and artist, I'm capable of creating original characters. However, to achieve the level of quality we want to reach, we need some help. Additionally, there are so many other things that need to be done that producing a reference illustration is only the beginning. That's why I've been working with Tanya to provide a virtual casting of people we'd like to cast. Starting with images of real people is a perfect option to figure out the appearance of the characters.

To generate new "people" based on these images, I've been using a process that involves Stable Diffusion and CLIP image interrogation. This generates a prompt describing what Stable Diffusion sees in the image, which I can then optimize and use in txt2img to start generating new illustrations.

After a number of iterations, I settled on a starting point to start generating illustrated examples using img2img. Similar to generating person examples, it's an iterative process of playing with settings and tweaking prompts until I find something desirable.

Once we find a nice example, we can use it to move on to the next phase. I like to take the generated art into Procreate, where I ink and color a clean version. I also start to play with matching a body to the head based on the chosen proportions.

Here are some examples of our generated references and illustrations:

We're excited about the progress we're making on the Gods Eye animated series and we can't wait to share more updates with you in the future. Stay tuned for more!
